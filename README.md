# Grind be gone (a mod for the game "Caves of Qud")

Just some tunings to help ease the grind.

- New wish: type 'reroll' (without the single quotes) to reset the seed to mutations, Brain Brine, Eaters' Nectar injector and Drop of Nectar.

- Gave some guaranteed items to Tam, dromad merchant (every trade interaction gives them).

- Increased to 100% the chance to absorb Ego when killing the Esper hunters.

- Added option to choose outcome when using Brain Brine and Eaters' nectar injector.

- When buying mutations, shows the entire list of possible mutations available to the character.

- Made possible to change Z level result behaviour of Space Time Vortexes via the mod file 'BetterZLevelTeleportation.cs'. To do so, manipulate the 'statRandomLow' and 'statRandomHigh' variables (default values are set).
