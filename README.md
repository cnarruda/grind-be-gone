# Grind be gone (a mod for the game "Caves of Qud")

Just some tunings to help ease the grind (and expedite your way to godhood).

- New wish: type 'reroll' (without the single quotes) to execute the XRL.World.GameObject.PermuteRandomMutationBuys() method (reset seed to mutations, brain brine, eaters' nectar and drop of nectar).

- Gave some guaranteed items to Tam, dromad merchant (every trade interaction gives them).

- Increased to 100% the chance to absorb Ego when killing the Esper hunters.

- Added option to choose outcome of Brain Brine consumption.

- When buying mutations, shows the entire list of possible mutations available to the character.
