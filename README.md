# Grind be gone (a mod for the game "Caves of Qud")

Just some tunings to help ease the grind (and expedite your way to godhood).

New wish: type 'reroll' (without the single quotes) to reroll most boring stuff like brain brine and eater's nectar result.

Gave some new cool items to our friend Tam the Dromad Merchant.

Increased to 100% the chance to get Ego absorbtion from killing the Esper hunters.
